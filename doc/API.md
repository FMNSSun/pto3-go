# Path Transparency Observatory API Specification

Path Transparency Observatory API specifiation, version 3

The API consists of three applications: raw data access and upload,
observation access, and observation query. The interface to each application
is made up of certain resources accessed in a RESTful way; these resources are
specified below.

# Access Control and Permissions

All applications use API key based access control. An API key is associated
with a set of *permissions*, scoped to permitted operations on the observatory
database, on access to raw data for specific campaigns. In this document, the
permission required for a given method on a given resource is noted.

API keys are given in the HTTP `Authorization` request header, which must
consist of the string `APIKEY` followed by whitespace and the API key as a
string.

# Raw Data Access and Upload

The raw data access and upload API (resources under `/raw`) allows the upload of
raw data files to the PTO, and the later retrieval of those files. Each file is
associated with a *campaign* -- a group of files related to a single measurement
campaign from a single data source. Campaigns and files have associated
*metadata* which is used by the PTO and analysis modules to save metadata about
the raw data; this may also be used by users of the PTO to store information
about raw files and campaigns. 

The resources and methods available thereon are summarized in the table below.

| Method   | Resource              | Permission      | Description                                   |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/raw`                | `list_raw`      | Retrieve URLs for campaigns as JSON           |
| `GET`    | `/raw/<c>`            | `read_raw:<c>`  | Retrieve metadata for campaign *c* as JSON    |
| `PUT`    | `/raw/<c>`            | `write_raw:<c>` | Write metadata for campaign *c* as JSON       |
| `GET`    | `/raw/<c>/<f>`        | `read_raw:<c>`  | Retrieve metadata for file *f* in *c* as JSON |
| `PUT`    | `/raw/<c>/<f>`        | `write_raw:<c>` | Write metadata for file *f* in *c* as JSON    |
| `GET`    | `/raw/<c>/<f>/data`   | `read_raw:<c>`  | Retrieve content for file *f* in *c* (by convention) |
| `PUT`    | `/raw/<c>/<f>/data`   | `write_raw:<c>` | Write content for file *f* in *c*  (by convention) |
| `DELETE` | `/raw/<c>/<f>`        | `write_raw:<c>` | Delete a file and its metadata                |
| `DELETE` | `/raw/<c>`            | `write_raw:<c>` | Delete a campaign and all its files           |

## Metadata

Associated with each file and each campaign in the raw data store is a *metadata
object*. This metadata object is a set of key-value pairs, presented by the API
as a JSON object. Certain keys in this object are reserved for use by the
system, or are generated by the system. Other metadata keys can be freely used
by the creator of a raw data file to communicate metadata information with a
future analysis process that will be run on the raw data, or for future
retrieval of the file. Metadata key behavior is determined by the metadata key
name:

- All metadata keys whose names begin with an underscore `_` are reserved for
  system use; they may be written to, but have a special meaning to the PTO itself. 
- All metadata keys whose names begin with `__` are virtual, and
  generated by the system; they may not be written to.
- All other metadata key names are free for use by users and analysis modules.

Files inherit metadata from their containing campaign. If a file's metadata and
its containing campaign's metadata have metadata for the same key, the value
associated with file overrides that inherited from the campaign for that file.

The following reserved and virtual metadata keys are presently supported:

| Key             | Description                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_file_type`    | PTO filetype. See Filetypes, below.                                     |
| `_owner`        | Identity (via email) of user or organization owning the file/campaign   |
| `_time_start`   | Timestamp of first observation in the raw data file, in ISO8601 format  |
| `_time_end`     | Time of last observation in the raw data file, in ISO8601 format        |
| `__data`        | URL of the resource containing file data.                               |
| `__data_size`   | Size of the file in bytes. 0 if the data file has not been uploaded.    |

Though the data resource is by convention accessible by appending `/data` to the
path of the metadata resource, the system may at any time place data at another
path; therefore, clients should only upload data to the path given in the
`__data` metadata key.

### Filetypes

Every raw data file has a *filetype*, given in the `_file_type` key, which the
PTO uses to determine how to handle files internally, and which analysis modules
use to determine how to read and whether they are interested in raw data files.
Each filetype is associated with a MIME type, and the `Content-Type` header on
data uploads via PUT must match the filetype associated with the file. 

Often, all the files within a campaign will share the same filetype. In this
case, filetype information is set in campaign metadata, not in individual file
metadata.

While filetypes are extensible, the filetypes supported by the PTO as installed
are listed below:

| Filetype            | MIME type                     | Description                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------|---------------------------------------------- |
| `obs-bz2`           | `application/bzip2`           | Compressed observations in [OSF](OBSETS.md) |
| `obs`               | `application/vnd.mami.ndjson` | Uncompressed observations in [OSF](OBSETS.md) |

## Raw data API usage

We use [curl](https://curl.haxx.se) to illustrate the usage of the PTO raw API.
We assume the API is rooted at `https://pto.example.com/`, and that the API
key `12345` holds the permissions `list_raw`, `read_raw:test`, and
`write_raw:test`.

# Observation Access
 
The observation access API (resources under `/obs`) allows access to PTO
*observations*. An observation is a tuple consisting of the following elements:

- a time interval during which the observation is valid, consisting of a 
  _start time_ and an _end time_;
- a _path_ on which the observation is made, consisting of a sequence of 
  _path elements_;
- a _condition_ observed on this path; and 
- an optional _value_ associated with the condition.

Observations are grouped into *observation sets*. An observation set is a set of
observations resulting from a single run of an analyser on some input data (see
Data Analysis, below). All observations in an observation set share the same
metadata and *provenance*. Provenance provides information about the source data
that was analyzed (in terms of raw data files and/or other observation sets
stored in the PTO) and the analysis that was performed.

The resources and methods available thereon are summarized in the table below.

| Method   | Resource        | Permission | Description                                           |
| -------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/obs`          | `read_obs` | Retrieve URLs for observation sets as JSON            |
| `POST`    | `/obs/create`  | `write_obs` | Create new observation set                         |
| `GET`    | `/obs/<o>`      | `read_obs` | Retrieve metadata and provenance for *o* as JSON      |
| `PUT`    | `/obs/<o>`      | `write_obs` | Update metadata and provenance for *o* as JSON      |
| `GET`    | `/obs/<o>/data` | `read_obs` | Retrieve obset file for *o* as NDJSON (by convention) |
| `PUT`    | `/obs/<o>/data` | `read_obs` | Upload obset file for *o* as NDJSON (by convention) |

## Metadata and Provenance

As with raw data files, observation sets have associated metadata; as with raw
data files, arbitrary metadata can be set on observation sets by the analyses
that create them. The same rules for reserved and virtual metadata names apply
for observation sets as for raw data. The metadata for an observation set also
contains information about the observation set's provenance.

Provenance is tracked by three metadata keys. `_sources` is an array of URLs
referencing the raw data file or the observation set(s) from which the
observations in an observation set are derived. `_analyzer` is a URL referring
to the analyzer that created the observation set. `_campaign` is a URL referring
to the campaign from which the original raw data was derived, and is only
present if the observation set is derived only from observation sets / raw data
in the same campaign.

The following reserved and virtual metadata keys are presently supported:

| Key             | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `_sources`      | Array of PTO URLs of raw data sources and observation sets   |
| `_analyzer`     | URL of analyzer metadata                                     |
| `_conditions`   | Array of conditions declared in the observation set          |
| `__obs_count`   | Count of observations in the observation set                 |
| `__data`        | URL of the resource containing observation set data          |

## Analyzer Metadata

Observations refer to how they were created via the `_analyzer` metadata key.
This either contains a URL pointing at an analyzer metadata object, or a URL
pointing at a source code repository, including tag referring to a specific
revision or commit, which itself contains analyzer metadata in a file named
`__pto_analyzer_metadata.json` in its root directory.

Analyzer metadata is stored as a JSON object, which must have the following
keys:

| Key             | Description                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_repository`   | URL of source code repository, if not implicit                          |
| `_owner`        | Identity (via email) of user or organization owning the analyzer        |
| `_file_types`   | File types consumable by raw analyzer, as array                         |
| `_invocation`   | Command to run in repository root to invoke the analyzer, if local      |
| `_platform`     | Platform identifier; see [interface description](ANALYZER.md)           |

As with raw and observation metadata, all keys not beginning with `_` are
freeform, and may be used to store other information about the analyzer.

An analyzer can be one of two types. A _raw_ analyzer (or _normalizer_) reads
in raw data of one or more filetypes, and produces observations. A _derived_
analyzer reads in observations from one or more sets, and produces
observations. Raw analyzer metadata must contain a `_file_types` key, a JSON
array listing PTO filetypes it can consume; derived analyzer metadata must not
contain this key.

Analyzers can take one of two forms. A _local_ analyzer is designed to run
within the PTO, with direct access to raw data files or observations. It reads
raw data or [observation files](OBSETS.md) on standard input, and produces
observation files and observation set metadata on standard output. Local
analyzer metadata must contain an `_invocation` key, which is a command to run
in the repository root to invoke the analyzer. More on the interface for local
analyzers is given [here](ANALYZER.md).

A local analyzer runtime is not yet available in the PTO.

A _client_ analyzer is designed to use the PTO API to retrieve raw data and
observation sets and upload its results. As it cannot be automatically
invoked, client analyzer repositories should contain human-readable
documentation for invocation. Client analyzer metadata must not contain an
`_invocation` key.

See [the analyzer interface description](ANALYZER.md) for more.

## Observation API usage

As above, we use [curl](https://curl.haxx.se) to illustrate the usage of the
PTO observation API. We assume the API is rooted at
`https://pto.example.com/`, and that the API key `12345` holds the permissions
`read_obs` and `write_obs`.

# Observation Query

The observation query API (resources under `/query`) allows the submission of
*queries* to the PTO, to retrieve observations and observation aggregates
meeting certain criteria from the PTO's observation database. 

| Method   | Resource            | Permission      | Description                                            |
| -------- | ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `POST` or `GET` | `/query/submit` | `submit_query`  | Submit a query                                         |
| `GET`    | `/query`            | `read_query`    | List currently cached and pending queries              |
| `GET`    | `/query/<q>`        | `read_query`    | Get query metadata, including ETA for pending queries  |
| `GET`    | `/query/<q>/result` | `read_query`    | Get query results (by convention)                      |
| `PUT`    | `/query/<q>`        | `update_query`  | Update query metadata                                  |

Queries can be submitted by POSTing to the /query/submit resource. The query
itself is defined by a the parameters in the POSTed
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content. The parameters are summarized
below:

| Parameter       | Semantics | Multiple? | Meaning                                                          |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `time_start`    | temporal  | no        | Select observations starting at or after the given start time    |
| `time_end`      | temporal  | no        | Select observations ending at or before the given end time       |
| `set`           | select    | yes       | Select observations with in the given set ID                     |
| `on_path`       | select    | yes       | Select observations with the given element in the path           | 
| `source`        | select    | yes       | Select observations with the given element at the start of the path |
| `target`        | select    | yes       | Select observations with the given element at the end of the path |
| `condition`     | select    | yes       | Select observations with the given condition, with wildcards      |
| `group_by`      | group     | yes       | Group observations and return counts by group  |
| `intersect_condition` | set | yes       | Group observations by path, select paths by set intersection on conditions |
| `option`        | options   | yes       | Specify a query option |

All parameters with temporal semantics must be present, and are used to bound
the query in time. Parameters with select semantics may be given to filter
observations. if multiple instances of a select parameter are available, any of
the values will match; however, an observation must match at least one of the
values for each distinct parameter given (i.e., the query language supports AND
of OR semantics). Parameters with group or set semantics, as well as the option parameter, may modify the type of
query and the format of its results; see the [Results](#results) section below.

## Query Options 

The `option` parameter is used to modify the behavior of queries. Multiple Options may be present. The following options are presently supported:

| Option Value | Behavior                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sets_only`  | Return links to observation sets containing observations answering the query, instead of observation data directly |

## Metadata

When a query is submitted, it goes into the query cache. The query cache holds
the query metadata until the query has been scheduled to run. Once it has run,
the query metadata will updated to point to the result and the observation sets
the query answers.

| Key             | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `__parameters`  | URL-encoded parameters from which the query was generated                |
| `__state`       | Query state; see below                                       |
| `__result`      | URL of the resource containing complete result, when available |
| `__sources`     | Array of PTO URLs of observation sets covered by the query, when available   |
| `_ext_ref`      | External reference for a permanence request; see below |

A query can have one of following states:

| State           | Meaning                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `submitted`     | Submitted, but not yet running          |
| `pending`       | Running and awaiting results            |
| `failed`        | Abnormally ended without returning results |
| `complete`      | Results are available                   |
| `permanent`     | Results are available and cached results will be stored permanently |

## Results

The type of the query determines the format of the results, as below:

### Observation Selection Queries

A query created without any `group_by` or `intersect_condition` parameters and
without the `sets_only` option is a selection query. The observations returned
by this query are those within the interval between the `time_start` and
`time_end` parameters which match the selection parameters.

*[EDITOR'S NOTE: matching rules go here, describe condition wildcards.]*

The result of a selection query is a JSON object, the fields of which are as follows:

| Key            | Value 
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------|
| `prev`         | Link to previous page (see Pagination)              |
| `next`         | Link to next page (see Pagination)                  |
| `obs`          | JSON array containing observations in [OSF format](OBSETS.md) |

### Observation Set Selection Queries

A query created without any `group_by` or `intersect_condition` parameters and
with the `sets_only` option is a selection query. The observations returned
by this query are those within the interval between the `time_start` and
`time_end` parameters which match the selection parameters.

| Key            | Value 
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------|
| `prev`         | Link to previous page (see Pagination)              |
| `next`         | Link to next page (see Pagination)                  |
| `sets`         | JSON array containing links to observation sets containing observations answering the query | 

### Condition Set Intersection Queries

A query created with one or more `intersect_condition` parameters is a set
intersection query. First, observations matching the selection parameters are
selected. Then, the observations are grouped by paths, and only paths within each set listed in
`intersect_condition` parameters are selected. 

An `intersect_condition` parameter is either a full condition name (i.e.,
without wildcards), or a full condition name prefixed with the character `!`
(urlencoded `%21`). In the former case, the set is of all paths for which there
is at least one observation with the specified condition. In the latter case,
the set is negated, i.e. the set of all paths for which there are no
observations with the specified condition. Foe example, a query with two
`intersect_condition` parameters with values `foo.bar` and `!foo.baz` will
select paths where there is at least one `foo.bar` observation and no `foo.baz`
observations.

The result of a set intersection query is a JSON object, the fields of which are as follows:

| Key            | Value 
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------|
| `prev`         | Link to previous page (see Pagination)              |
| `next`         | Link to next page (see Pagination)                  |
| `paths`        | JSON array containing paths as strings              |

### Aggregation Queries

A query created with one or more `group_by` parameters is an aggregation query.
The results will return the count of obsevations selected by the select
parameters for each group parameter. The following `group_by` parameters are
available:

| Value         | Meaning                                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `year`        | Count by year of time_start                        | 
| `month`       | Count by year/month of time_start                  |
| `day`         | Count by year/month/day of time_start              |
| `hour`        | Count by year/month/day/hour of time_start         |
| `week`        | Count by year/week (starting Monday) of time_start |
| `week_day`    | Count by day of week of time_start (7 groups)      |
| `day_hour`    | Count by hour of day of time_start (24 groups)     | 
| `condition`   | Count by condition                                 |
| `source`      | Count by first element in path                     |
| `target`      | Count by last element in path                      |

The result of an aggregation query is a JSON object, the fields of which are as follows:

| Key            | Value                                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------|
| `prev`         | Link to previous page (see Pagination)              |
| `next`         | Link to next page (see Pagination)                  |
| `groups`       | *[EDITOR'S NOTE: determine best way to represent this]* |


# Pagination

API resources which return lists of URLs or results in arrays in JSON objects
support *pagination*. By default, if more than 20 items will be returned in the
list around which a resource is centered, the results will be paginated: the
top-level JSON object will gain a `next` key if the result is not the last page,
and a `prev` key if the result is not the first page. Pagination is controlled
using the following GET parameters:

| Parameter     | Meaning                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `page`        | Page number, beginning with 0. Defaults to 0                      |
| `pagination`  | Count of items per page. Default is resource-specific. If 0, disable pagination |

Pagination is applied to the following elements on the following resources:

| Resource            | Element paginated   | Pagination default |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| `/raw`              | `campaigns`         | tbd                |
| `/raw/<c>`          | `files`             | tbd                |
| `/obs`              | `sets`              | tbd                |
| `/analysis`         | `analyzers`         | tbd                |
| `/analysis/<a>`     | `analyses`          | tbd                |
| `/query`            | `queries`           | tbd                |
| `/query/<q>/result` | `results`           | tbd                |
